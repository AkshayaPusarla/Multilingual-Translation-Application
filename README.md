# Multilingual-Translation-Application

A web application that seamlessly bridges the gap between transliteration and translation. This project allows users to input Romanized text of any supported language and receive the equivalent text in both native script and its meaningful translation in the target language.

## Features

**Romanized Text Transliteration:** Converts Romanized input text into the native script of the selected source language.

**Meaningful Translation:** Provides accurate and meaningful translations of the input text into the target language's script.

**Language Options:** Supports multiple languages, including English, Hindi, Telugu, French, and more.

**User-Friendly Interface:** A simple, responsive frontend for seamless interaction.

## How It Works

**Frontend Interface:** Users enter Romanized text, choose source and target languages, and trigger translation using a responsive HTML and JavaScript-based interface.

**Backend Processing:** A Flask-powered Python backend leverages Google Translate's API for transliteration and translation.

**Output Display:** The translated text appears in the selected target language's native script.

## Technologies Used

**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript for a clean, responsive UI.

**Backend:** Python and Flask for processing and API integration.

**Translation API:** Google Translate API for accurate transliterations and translations.
